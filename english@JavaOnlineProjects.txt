Добрый день. Подскажите что спрашивают на собеседовании по english, какие вопросы? Как понимаю тематика будет рассказ о себе и прочие смежные темы


levrun [4:27 PM] 
Могут и интервью провести на английском. Если ежедневная работа предполагает общение с англоязычными коллегами/клиентами то это довольно естественное требование. Лучше заранее уточнять в каком объеме нужен английский у HR.


[4:28] 
В мою текущую компанию вопросы были следующие:

[4:28] 
1. Расскажите о себе и свой рабочий опыт.


[4:28] 
2. Далее про хобби.

[4:28] 
3. Какая то тема на отвлеченную тему связанная с моими ответами на 1 и 2


[4:29] 
Проверка велась учителем английского, где она учитывала: fluency, grammar, vocabulary, soft skills. (edited)


[4:30] 
Из грамматики: правильное использование past, perfect, future, conditionals.


[4:32] 
Например вопрос: "Чем бы ты был полезен если бы компания взяла бы тебя на работу?" предполагает ответа в правильном conditional. И т.п. (edited)


gesha [4:36 PM] 
ну там вроде все проще, спросили сможете ли рассказать о себе на english


[4:36] 
и в требованиях указано english intermediate


levrun [4:37 PM] 
Рекомендую заранее проработать мок-интервью. Запиши свой голос, поработай над ошибками.


[4:37] 
Имей заготовки. В 90 % случаев вопросы стандартны.

gesha [4:37 PM] 
хочу тоже попробовать


[4:38] 
почему и спросил

[4:38] 
примерно знаю вопросы


[4:38] 
но в основном проверка тестами была


levrun [4:40 PM] 
Но всегда надо готовиться к худшему. Например к такому:

English, Motherfucker, do you speak it?
 


[4:41] 
Без пушки в сапоге не ходи туда :joy:



gesha [4:49 PM] 
)))


[4:49] 
помогает?


iaroslav.vak [8:28 PM] 
У меня было такое, что и тим лид спрашивал пару простых технических вопросов на английском, но у нас тесное общение с заказчиком. Так что в подготовке к каким то техническим вещам неплохо думать о том, как бы ты ответил на это на английском.



----- Today November 30th, 2017 -----
defneo [8:27 AM] 
А можно по-подробнее про conditional?
levrun
Из грамматики: правильное использование past, perfect, future, conditionals.
Posted in #englishNov 28th at 4:30 PM


[8:27] 
Что конкретно имеется ввиду?


micredis [8:53 AM] 
I advise you to google something like: "zero conditional, first conditional" etc. (up to the third one :-) (edited)


micredis [9:08 AM] 
The most important rule is to avoid "if + will" combination, which you should use only if you really know what you're doing :slightly_smiling_face:


igorbrest [11:07 AM] 
английский выучить несложно
сказали "вай?" - ответь "бекоз"
если "дринкин?" - скажи "офкоз"


levrun [11:39 AM] 
Помимо zero, one, two, three есть еще mixed conditionals.


[11:40] 
Кто хочет постигнуть премудрости conditionals советую например распечатать на холодильник 0, 1, 2, 3, 2 mixed cond с примерами.


levrun [11:45 AM]

[11:48] 
Каждое утро 5-10 минут. Во время завтрака зазубриваешь пока не сможешь без бумажки. Через 3-4 месяца ты запомнишь conditionals. И будешь их выцеплять из живой речи и использовать осмысленно.


[11:48] 
Самый популярный это first и second


[11:49] 
Т.е. просто один раз прочитать и понять недостаточно. Нужно каждодневно повторять.


[11:49] 
Но это так вообще с любым языком. Не используешь , забываешь.


[11:50] 
If you did it every morning you would know conditionals perfectrly.


[11:53] 
If you had done it every morning you would have known it last year


[11:55] 
If you studied conditionals every day you wouldn't have had problems with it last exam (edited)


[11:57] 
If you had studied conditionals your english would be better now


[11:57] 
If you study conditionals your english will be better


[11:57] 
If you study conditionals your english become better


[11:57] 
:nerd_face:


[11:58] 
Определите, где здесь какие conditionals :slightly_smiling_face: И каков правильный перевод на русский. (edited)


micredis [1:08 PM] 
Or instead of memorizing the rules, you could just expose yourself to a massive authentic audio/visual input. Things like audiobooks, news and other stuff that you might be interested in. Because to understand how the rules work you don't really need to memorize them. 5-6 year old kids use pretty much correct grammar patterns without studying any grammar rules.


[1:11] 
Although, this is just another approach and you should probably try both of them (to study rules or to use an "authentic immersion"). Of course, you could wisely mix them, but it's not necessary to my mind. (edited)


levrun [1:24 PM] 
From my expirience only inputs are not enough :point_up:  There should be outputs. A lot of outputs. Speaking, writing  and somebody have to fix your mistakes definetely.  Passive listening and reading doesn't guarranty good level of immersion.


[1:25] 
5-6 year old kids use pretty much correct grammar patterns without studying any grammar rules. <--- but we are not a children anymore and we don't have such "study language mode" turned on.


[1:25] 
So it's usually different methods to learn languages when you are child and when you are adult


[1:27] 
But I agree with you: only learining grammar rules are not enough.


[1:29] 
From my exp: everybody says that listening radio or tvshows gives you understanding of language. "Just watch 1h per day. " And I don't agree with that. If you listening and don't understand it's a waste of time. (edited)


[1:33] 
It could be useful when you actively use language(speaking, writing) and adding new words from vocabularly or context while reading.


micredis [1:33 PM] 
Yeah, I agree with you as well. Output is just another side of the issue. BUUT :slightly_smiling_face: According to the latest research [here should be a link, but trust me], the ratio you should spend on listening/reading/(writing+speaking) is about 70/20/10.


levrun [1:34 PM] 
links please, very interesting for me :slightly_smiling_face:


antonioprime [1:35 PM] 
Very interesting for me too!


levrun [1:37 PM] 
I hope it's not studies of scientists who get "Ig Nobel Prize" for their work (edited)


micredis [1:47 PM] 
I just want to clarify :slightly_smiling_face:. You may want to peek into a text-book sometimes which is also very helpful. I'm just trying to say that making a text-book (i.e. memorizing-the-rules approach) your main resource for learning is generally a bad idea.
As to myself, I've just found a couple of language partners (one form the US, another from Wales, GB) who learn Russian. And I must admit, it's very helpful. BUUT. I had devoted a hell of a lot of time listening/reading before I felt myself ready enough for such a venture. (edited)


[1:49] 
Speaking of the ratio, doesn't it sound as a common sense as to provide more input activities than output ones? :slightly_smiling_face: Anyway, it looks like you're making me to spend some time looking for supporting evidence :slightly_smiling_face: (edited)


[1:52] 
At the moment I just can mention Stephen Krashen & Co.


[1:54] 
He doesn't seem like someone who deserves Ig Nobel Prize.


[1:55] 
One: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X96000632


[1:56] 
Two: "...*speaking ability emerges on its own* after enough competence has been developed *by listening* and understanding" (edited)


[1:56] 
http://www.sdkrashen.com/content/books/principles_and_practice.pdf


Ibid.: "Adults, and children in formal language classes, are usually not allowed a _silent period_. They are often asked to produce very early in a second language, before they have acquired enough syntactic competence to express their ideas." (edited)


[2:01] 
Considering your remark: From my exp: everybody says that listening radio or tvshows gives you understanding of language. "Just watch 1h per day. "


[2:02] 
My answer is: basically, 1 hour is not enough. Period :slightly_smiling_face: (edited)


But to avoid acquiring only a "noise" without comprehension, it is crucial that the input would be active. (edited)


I mean, you shouldn't just passively listen, for example. But instead, try to dissect what you listen, keep a notebook at hand, and _sometimes_ look up a pattern or a phrase in the dictionary, or do other kind of research. (edited)


[2:09] 
Although, if we'are advising a beginner, we must admit that it is a whole new ball game :slightly_smiling_face: (edited)


[2:11] 
..and we should probably choose another tactic in the first place. They may want to consider TPR with subsequent transition to TPRS techniques to get to the (Pre-)Intermediate level. TPR, TPRS could be easily googled: "wiki TPR", "wiki TPRS" (no grammar rules before that stage _at all_). (edited)


micredis [2:20 PM] 
And finally: "The skill-building hypothesis claims that we must first learn the rules of language consciously and they become automatic through output practice and correction. *I will argue* that current research claiming to show *that this hypothesis is correct* is consistent with the Monitor hypothesis, which claims that the _use and application of conscious knowledge is severely limited_". (from here: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.121.728&rep=rep1&type=pdf ) See also tables there with some interesting numbers.
"Given the consistent evidence for comprehensible input (Krashen, 1994) and failure of other means of developing language competence, *providing more comprehensible input seems to be a more reasonable strategy than increasing output*." (edited)


levrun [3:25 PM] 
Thanks for the links. I'm going to read it in free time.


[3:25] 
Regarding grammar studies I wanna mention that I only speak about conditionals.


micredis [3:25 PM] 
You're welcome. I hope this will help.


levrun [3:26 PM] 
I had bad exp learning it but 3-4 monthes ago I decided to change tactic and introduce "everyday 10 min repetitions in front of fridge. And it helped in my case.


[3:27] 
I mean I see some progress going on on conditionals. Not sure about other areas of english grammar.


micredis [3:31 PM] 
Yeah, we're all different, that's for sure. And it is quite reasonable having some knowledge about best practices to experiment in order to find an approach that works best for you.


levrun [3:38 PM] 
the ratio you should spend on listening/reading/(writing+speaking) is about 70/20/10 <--- btw, where you get these numbers? I haven't found them in provided article.


[3:41] 
I mean, it's easier to get comprehensible! input from reading. As we can use vocabulary. In case of listening it's harder as you should look back  re-listen and sometimes you don't have option to move back as it's live video or radio. (edited)


[3:41] 
So this numbers 70 and 20. It's very interesting where are they come from?


micredis [3:55 PM] 
> you don't have option to move back as it's live video or radio...
(edited)


[3:55] 
Podcasts will do the trick :slightly_smiling_face:


[3:56] 
But most of the times it's not necessary, really.


[3:56] 
I mean here, pausing and repeating. (edited)


[3:57] 
It is considered to be more useful to repeat the whole "episode" (or whatever piece of audio you listen to). (edited)


[3:59] 
The key thing is to choose a kind of material that ~>75% you could understand without looking at the dictionary.


[4:00] 
To understand from the context.


[4:02] 
As for the particular numbers, I guess that it was an audio source that I'm referring to, which is quite predictable in my case :slightly_smiling_face: as I am a proponent of such an approach. (edited)


[4:03] 
You'll hear those numbers yourself after receiving my letter.


[4:03]

levrun [4:05 PM] 
I'm addicted to tv-shows. Can't imagine everyday supper without it. But after 2 years of everyday supper with tv-show(just watching without any additional excer.) I found that I'm stuck on my current level. So I started to add some additional tricks. As write down some new words or phrases and  try to use it during my regular english classes with teacher.


micredis [4:06 PM] 
Oh, that's a good approach


[4:06] 
As I said, listening should be active


levrun [4:09 PM] 
Totally agree


micredis [4:09 PM] 
In my case, I used to binge watch a lot of series as well, but I had been doing it not on a couch, but at the desk using a computer, turning subtitles on and off and with the active lingualeo plugin for adding words and phrases. (edited)


levrun [4:14 PM] 
Yeahh, Netflix could be great help with subtitles and so on


[4:14] 
And also puzzle-movies.com


micredis [4:17 PM] 
Unfortunately, such an approach requires a lot of devoted time which most of the people just can't afford on a regular basis. So, as I said, podcasts could do the trick.


[4:18] 
And the real people, of course. Meaning, native speakers.


[4:21] 
In the best case scenario, it could be someone who has the same area of interests, that is someone from your professional realm. (edited)


levrun [4:23 PM] 
But you spend time listening podcast, isn't it? I still waiting regarding 70/20/10. As I have started to thinking about increasing time in reading books. And your theory states that it's not so effective as listening. So it's very interesting for me to understand this.


micredis [4:23 PM] 
> I still waiting regarding 70/20/10.


[4:23] 
Just a little bit of patience, please :slightly_smiling_face:


levrun [4:24 PM] 
Meaning, native speakers. <--- not exactly "natives". When I relocated to Poland I had to speak with them in english. And that gave me some level up. As you speak in English everyday.


micredis [4:25 PM] 
Hey, weren't you in Warsaw this summer)))


levrun [4:26 PM] 
I was


micredis [4:26 PM] 
Yeah, non-natives will do as well.


[4:27] 
>I was


[4:27] 
Me too


[4:28] 
But you should be aware of mistakes they make


[4:28] 
(here I speak about non-natives)


[4:29] 
Those kind of mistakes are hard to get rid of.


levrun [4:29 PM] 
That's true. I wonder how many mistakes I generate :slightly_smiling_face:


micredis [4:30 PM] 
But otherwise, I agree that all kind of real-life practice is useful.


levrun [4:31 PM] 
But you also work in Poland?


micredis [4:31 PM] 
And speaking of podcasts. You can listen to them in a car, while shaving, cooking, washing dishes, walking, you name it.


[4:32] 
> But you also work in Poland?


[4:32] 
Nope. I've just spend a couple of months there with my wife.


[4:33] 
Now she constantly tells me that we must return there.


levrun [4:33 PM] 
And speaking of podcasts. <--- I should totally give it a try.


micredis [4:33 PM] 
> And speaking of podcasts. <--- I should totally give it a try.


levrun [4:34 PM] 
Consider also Krakow is better and Wroclaw is closer to Europe.


micredis [4:34 PM] 
Your English skills will skyrocket, you'll see. (edited)


[4:35] 
Yeah. My wife, actually, got a lot of positive impressions of Szczecin.


[4:36] 
She'd spent there about 10 days before she met me in Warsaw.


[4:36] 
It really seems that we should call it a day, levrun.


[4:37] 
Colleagues might consider our dialogue as an off-top.


levrun [4:38 PM] 
if it's in english...


[4:38] 
:slightly_smiling_face: it's not off-top


[4:39] 
but I agree, I should do some work here :slightly_smiling_face:


micredis [4:39 PM] 
In case of any questions you can just HMU writing a personal message.


levrun [4:39 PM] 
let's get down to business :slightly_smiling_face:


micredis [4:40 PM] 
~I hope that someone would find our discussion useful~. :slightly_smiling_face: I wonder if someone will find our discussion useful. (edited)


[4:43] 
@defneo In the above sentence you may find an example of legitimate combination of _if + will_.

[10:35] 
Although the title is quite flashy, that kind of approach is worth your consideration, in my opinion.


[10:37] 
There's no dictionaries, no grammar rules, just a plain input. Even without a teacher (i.e. unsupervised) :slightly_smiling_face: It also says (and this might encourage you) that humans who had resorted to that same approach outperformed the AI (so it works for humans even better:). (edited)

Personal corrrespondence with levrun:
-------------------------------------
micredis [3:50 PM] 
If you're interested, I could send you my recommendations that I wrote some time ago (actually, when I'd been studying the language for less than a year or so :slightly_smiling_face:. I find that approach quite successful in my case, although at the moment, those particular materials seem not as helpful as they used to be. But as a starter they'd helped me quite a lot, before I gained momentum and started to work both ways :slightly_smiling_face: (I mean when I broke out of my "silent period"). (edited)


levrun [3:52 PM] 
Yes I'm. Please send it to me to levrun1@gmail.com or just here.


[3:53] 
Thanks for that I suppose I will get something new and it will help me to improve my english skills.


micredis [6:58 PM] 
I've sent you a letter with recommendations. You may find that the tone is a bit patronizing there, so I just bring you my apologies in advance (that tone was chosen for the original addressees of the letter).


levrun [6:58 PM] 
Thanks a lot!


levrun [1:27 AM] 
Thanks for email. Really interesting stuff. Some podcast I started to listen 3-5 years ago. But in the end only tv-shows survived.


[1:27] 
Чтобы научиться думать нужно обеспечить "массированный ввод данных". Другими словами - нужно реально много СЛУШАТЬ и ЧИТАТЬ. <--- here you are not saying about 70 20 rule :slightly_smiling_face:


[1:30] 
But I intuitively I feel that it should be everyday practice with 80% understandable inputs(LISTENING, READING) As if it's boring searching of vocabularly I wouldn't last 2 weeks of such training.


[1:30] 
Material should be interesting and addicted.


[1:31] 
And easy enough so you can browse it even if you sleepy or tired from work.

[1:33] 
A.J. Hoge - Real English Conversation Pack [2008, PDF + MP3] <--- this one seems like good stuff I always wanted to find

[1:33] 
are going to give it a try.

[1:33] 
BTW your writing skills are very good. I don't believe you havent' trained it somehow.


micredis [9:23 AM] 
Hey, I'm glad that you found something useful there.

[9:23] 
Speaking of 20% of reading, I'm not contradicting myself :slightly_smiling_face:

[9:24] 
I really think that 20% is A LOT


[9:24] 
Consider this:


[9:24] 
> нужно реально много СЛУШАТЬ и ЧИТАТЬ

[9:27] 
so you need a lot of listening and reading (instead of studying grammar, or forcing back upon output, i.e. premature writing and speaking). (edited)

micredis [9:36 AM] 
As for my writing, I've encountered that kind of slightly suspicious attitude before, especially from natives. But my answer is still, no, I've only resorted to such kind of approach when I was preparing to my IELTS exam, but that's another story and the amount of time that I spent preparing to writing part was really insignificant.

[9:40] 
> Some podcast I started to listen 3-5 years ago

[9:41] 
Then you do something wrong )))

[9:43] 
Because I've started practicing only in summer of 2014 :slightly_smiling_face:

[9:44] 
when I was in my mid thirties)))


[9:44] 
So I wasn't a 5-6 year old kid at that moment.

[9:46] 
> But I intuitively I feel that it should be _everyday practice_ with 80% *understandable inputs* (LISTENING, READING) As if it's boring searching of vocabularly I wouldn't last 2 weeks of such training.

One hundred percent hit!


[9:47]

[9:47] 
That's for sure!


[9:47] 
> And easy enough so you can browse it even if you sleepy or tired from work.

Было собеседование, английский я провалил естественно... Начались вопросы технического характера, и я не много подзавис)) Слова и мысли в голову вообще не лезли (растерялся что-ли). 
Посоветовал искать школу английского по методу Каллана. На проэкте было тесное общение с клиентом, ежедневные звонки в скайп, поэтому english было главное условие. И посоветовал, готовиться к техническому собесу на английском (что бы все технические вопросы мог отвечать на английском). Вот такой не большой опыт у меня был)) Теперь буду штурмовать english (edited)


eger [3:02 PM] 
Когда ездил на Филиппины английский учить, там как раз можно было взять руки по этому методу. Достаточно интересный метод, особенно для начинающих


maria [3:18 PM] 
Знаешь, самый лучший метод изучения английского - это хороший преподаватель и индивидуальные уроки, хотя бы по скайпу


iaroslav.vak [3:25 PM] 
В обучении всегда всё индивидуально :wink:


iaroslav.vak [3:36 PM] 
И имхо, руководствоваться нужно не просто какими то крутыми методиками(которые безусловно не просто так крутые), а результатами и удовольствием.
К примеру тебе могут рекомендовать крутого педагога\методику, от которого все без ума и быстро прогрессируют, но у тебя этого прогресса нету, то вполне нормально ставить вопрос, а нужен ли тебе этот педагог\методика.
Вариантов изучения вещей существует масса и то что тебе подходит в этот момент, может уже не быть для тебя актуальным через пару лет.


anpotashev [3:58 PM]

My brother had to sit TOEFL to get an internship in the US. (edited)


[12:27]

micredis [12:41 AM] 
Basically, everything that has something to do with immigration/education requires either IELTS (GB, Canada, Australia etc.) or TOEFL (USA).


micredis [12:52 AM] 
In case of the US, TOEFL is not as critical as IELTS for those who's planning to become a citizen of a country of the Commonwealth. In the latter case, it is mandatory to get a decent mark.


[12:53] 
"Decent" means 6 or more.

micredis [11:05 AM] 
There's no 'green card' for Canada, Australia or NZ :wink:


[11:07] 
And yes, even if you're a holy divine 'IT guy' you can't become a citizen of these countries without IELTS. They're fascists, I know)))


micredis [11:25 AM] 
@javadev In a nutshell, there's not much sense to take any of these tests 'just in case'. It's not only a waste of time and money, but also is a matter of their limited time of validity (usually, they expire in about 2-3 years, which may depend on a number of circumstances). So, when you need one, you'll find out about it just automatically; otherwise, just sit back an relax :slightly_smiling_face:

Joseph Redmon: How computers learn to recognize objects instantly
Ten years ago, researchers thought that getting a computer to tell the difference between a cat and a dog would be almost impossible. Today, computer vision systems do it with greater than 99 percent accuracy. How? Joseph Redmon works on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) system, an open-source method of object detection that can identify objects in images and video -- from zebras to stop signs -- with lightning-quick speed. In a remarkable live demo, Redmon shows off this important step forward for applications Show more…

Hey, dudes! Have a look at a bunch of unconventional techniques to study grammar. I know it might be interesting for some of you: https://github.com/Vedenin/code-for-learning-languages

Looks like pretty interesting approach for learning


javadev [11:12 AM] 
@levrun the video is great, specifically that part of it when the guy moves around and demonstrates instant object detection

I am a mother pheasant plucker. I pluck mother pheasants. I am the most pleasant mother pheasant plucker who ever plucked a mother pheasant.

dementevay [3:51 PM]
WTF? :open_mouth:

micredis [4:29 PM]
@levrun @dementevay It's a tongue twister I was told recently by a native friend. It sounded quite amusing in his performance, so when I saw people started hanging around on this channel posting random stuff, I couldn't help myself, but to recite it.

levrun [5:17 PM]
@micredis btw your level on Lingualeo is just awesome. Respect! You're the best `mother pheasant plucker` :slightly_smiling_face: (edited)

micredis [5:24 PM]
:grinning:


levrun [Yesterday at 5:26 PM]
I don't even want to think how many years I'd have to work to get the same level.


micredis [5:27 PM]
About 3, I guess.
I mean, from the level A2.
It's not that much really.

Кстати, я корректно перевел с русского? (Я даже не хочу думать сколько лет мне понадобиться чтобы получить такой же уровень.) Это же чаcть из second conditional(I would have to work to get the same level)? (edited)


micredis [17 hours ago]
Your translation looks good for me.


micredis [17 hours ago]
But to be honest, I just can't figure out which exactly conditional you've applied here :grinning:


micredis [17 hours ago]
I mean, I'd probably have to think, but I'm not going to :slightly_smiling_face:


levrun [17 hours ago]
:slightly_smiling_face:


levrun [17 hours ago]
If I wanted I would probably have to think


micredis [17 hours ago]
Yeah. Just do stuff, don't think twice.


levrun [17 hours ago]
Second conditional. Sometimes you just get second part from second conditional and use it.


levrun [17 hours ago]
But in general I agree, grammar should be automatical without thinking

micredis [17 hours ago]
A friend of mine from Cardiff once told me that they have some helper-words in English. After that I realized that I just have to stop confusing myself thinking too much while speaking.


micredis [16 hours ago]
I was very much amused by his *_helper-words_* :slightly_smiling_face:


levrun [16 hours ago]
helper-words?


micredis [16 hours ago]
Yep. A native who doesn't even bother to learn grammar and uses childish-like explanations as a substitution for the whole English grammar. So when I heard him, it's just dawned on me. (edited)


micredis [16 hours ago]
Like in that song, "don't think twice, it's all right" :slightly_smiling_face:


levrun [Yesterday at 5:28 PM]
But I see you mostly do grammar drills there. Is that for a reason? (edited)

micredis [17 hours ago]
There's no particular reason except a long lasted habit. In 5 days my subscription is finally going to expire and I'm not planning to extend it, since I don't see any reason anymore to do that. I kind of realized that at  this juncture I have more or less internalized so called _corpus of language_ and it became sort of self-sustained without any artificial activities.


micredis [17 hours ago]
I mean that it consumes time, 25 minutes a day give or take, which are amount to a considerable figure in the long run.


micredis [17 hours ago]
At a certain point I just realized that just to use the language (read, write, listen and speak) is more efficient than any kind of drills. But I still believe that when you start learning, those kinds of activities can be quite useful.


micredis [17 hours ago]
By _those kinds of activities_ I mean grammar drills, words repetition etc.


levrun [17 hours ago]
Around 25*300/60=125 hours per year. Good point. Starting from some level you just need to read book/watch film/etc


micredis [17 hours ago]
Exactly! :slightly_smiling_face:


micredis [Yesterday at 5:38 PM]
Actually, I use it for some weird reason _(legacy)_ to optimize a process of learning new words. I should've chosen Anki or a similar application instead of becoming a Lingualeo slave. There's a pattern: add new words--learn them--use "repetition" training--run through 4 grammar rules. On average, it takes about 25 minutes a day. Otherwise, I just practice with real people :slightly_smiling_face:. Plus I'm hooked to listening lectures, podcasts and audiobooks.

I've tried Anki, But leo is better IMO. It allows you to add new word right from chrome. Even when you are at work or on holidays.


levrun [17 hours ago]
I'm talking about their extension for chrome. Haven't found something better. (edited)


micredis [17 hours ago]
Yeah, but still... Aren't we all supposed to apply programmer's approach here and hammer out things as we want them, just creating our own stuff? :wink: (edited)


micredis [5:42 PM]
Btw, my son, who's 6 months of age, said his first word recently. And it was really loud and absolutely clear "ХАЙ!" :grinning: (And yes, there's no "У" in the middle, no). (edited)


micredis [6:17 PM]
Alex, I've got to go. Thank you for the conversation!

levrun [6:18 PM]
Thank you Denis. It was pleasure to finally speak with one of my active friends from Leo :slightly_smiling_face:
