@tema.emelyan No, but I wonder how and who teaches English. What progress reached.

tema.emelyan [8:45 AM] 
@vladimir.glinskikh in that case use the word "learns". To teach means to educate someone else. To learn means to gather knowledge for yourself. Very common confusion among Russians because in our language both words are translated to учить (edited)

I believe that the best way to learn the language is to listen as much as you can. It could be tricky to cram a sufficient amount of time of listening into your schedule. But it's not necessary to just sit and deliberately invest your time solely in it. You may listen while driving, doing chores, washing dishes, shaving, brushing teeth etc. :slightly_smiling_face: I generally listen to podcasts and audiobooks. You should also switch all your operating systems to English, as well as all of your google queries should be in English too. I could also advise you to find a language partner. It may take a while to find one, but there are people who want to learn Russian/other languages that you may speak. You just need to go on the Internet (to the places like language forums, iTalki.com etc.) and get some :slightly_smiling_face:

I'm listening for practice https://learningenglish.voanews.com/z/1689
VOA
Learning English Broadcast
Learning English news and feature programs use a limited vocabulary and are read at a slower pace than VOA's other English broadcasts. Previously known as Special English.
 


[12:38] 
it's not technical English, but useful

micredis [12:40 PM] 
Yeah, but aren't those guys a bit boring? :slightly_smiling_face:


[12:41] 
I can suggest you to listen to Stuff You Should Know. Another good one is Adam Ruins Everything. (edited)

astronarh [12:42 PM]

[12:42] 
for my level knowledge is normal


micredis [12:44 PM] 
Alright then. But you're right that VOA can be used instead of sleeping pills. (edited)

There are a lot of ways to improve your english skills. My way is to learn english with personal teacher. And of course, you should listen and read a lot.

>Results:
>Participants who consumed alcohol had significantly better observer-ratings for their Dutch language, specifically better pronunciation, compared with those who did not consume alcohol. However, alcohol had no effect on self-ratings of Dutch language skills.


>Conclusions:
>Acute alcohol consumption may have beneficial effects on the pronunciation of a foreign language in people who have recently learned that language.

I learned English here: https://www.it-academy.by/specialization/angliyskiy-dlya-it/ (Minsk location).
Right now I have everyday english experience with American colleagues. They understand me, I understand them. My current level: pre-intermediate. (edited)
 

micredis [1:33 PM] 
Well, alcohol definitely erases some barriers, mostly psychological, which may be helpful for kind of self-concerned personalities. On the other hand, the pronunciation becomes a little bit slurred, and can be perceived by native speakers that you're just sort of tipsy, but not someone with a heavy accent.

what? (edited)


[1:37] 
understood :joy:

micredis [1:37 PM] 
For instance, my friend, who's a native speaker of English from California, says that when I speak with the mouthful, it sounds more natural :slightly_smiling_face: I mean, the accent is disguised by distorted pronunciation (due to some food in my mouth).


astronarh [1:39 PM]

I sometimes listen to software development/computer science podcasts. Great way to squeeze at least a little bit of productivity from your daily commute. Although some of them are quite challenging. http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/15-top-notch-podcasts-programmers-software-developers/
